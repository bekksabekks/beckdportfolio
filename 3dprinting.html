  <h2>3D PRINTING</h2>
  <p><div class="subtitle"><i>Transferring my sculpture to real life</i></div></p>
  <p>For our topic on 3D printing, my class was separated into groups in which we would pick a theme for our 3D prints based on an emotion. My teammates were Maggie, Leah, and Belle, and together we decided to base our project on the sensation of unease. Since macabre things like cadavers and such tend to give the average person a sense of unease, we figured we would each make a different type of animal skull on Blender to later print out. Our group name was Vulture Culture.</p>

  <p>I decided on making a hyena skull, so I looked through the internet for good references on a hyena skull with different perspectives. Eventually, I found a Github tool that provides a catalog of different 3D models of animal skulls that you can rotate to get a view of its different angles. You can find the link to the tool <a href="https://x6ud.github.io/#/">here.</a></p>

  <p>I took screenshots of the skull at four different angles to transfer onto Blender as reference images. After sufficient enough set-up, I simply got to work making my own 3D model of a hyena skull.</p>

  <p>With the model done, I exported it as an .stl and imported it onto Ultimaker Cura to prep it for printing and slice it. I then exported it as a .3mf and submitted it to the Maker's Lab at SJSU's engineering building to have it get printed out. Thankfully, the lab was quick and I very soon had my model in physical form. I'm pleased with how it turned out, it seems everything was able to translate well when printing.</p>

<p>By the time I had mine printed out, Maggie already had hers, and it wasn't long before Belle also had her model printed. With three of our models done, it was a good opportunity for Maggie to take a few pictures of them together. I think our designs together looked cohesive, and I'm satisfied with how they turned out together to fit the theme.</p>
