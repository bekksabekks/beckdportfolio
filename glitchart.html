  <h2>GLITCH/MASH-UP ART</h2>
  <p><div class="subtitle"><i>Making art by bending files</i></div></p>
  <p>For ART-74, our first project was on glitch and mash-up art. The focus of this project was to bend the intended purpose of computer files to, in a sense, "break" them and create your own work of art out of the outcome.</p>
  <p>After fiddling around with different images and collaging them together, this is what I was able to create:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="glitchmashup.jpeg" alt="Glitch Art" style="width: 75%">
</div>

<p>Since the conventions of glitch art tend to be rather chaotic, I decided to make the theme of my project rather animalistic to pair up with the unpredictability of this style of art. With each image that I pulled from the internet, I found a different little way to play around with it.</p>
<p>I fiddled around with a few of them by opening jpegs in a text file editor, but because I found it difficult to get any results from them that didn't result in most of the image being blanked out, I only limited this method to about two of the files.</p>
<p>For the rest, I experimented with gradually deteriorating image quality through two methods: repeatedly exporting and compressing JPEGs and opening a JPEG on MS Paint, sizing it down, saving it as a separate file, then opening up the new file and blowing up the size. Both methods resulted in glaring JPEG artifacts littered throughout the images.</p>
<p>I opened these finished results on Photoshop and collaged them together alongside some unbroken/uncompressed image files that I simply changed the blending styles on to fit the chaotic style of the rest of the pictures. The result is messy, distorted, and rather disturbing. Just the way I like it.</p>
