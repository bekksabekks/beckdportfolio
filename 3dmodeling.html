  <h2>3D MODELING</h2>
  <p><div class="subtitle"><i>I'm over here, extruding faces. You know how it is.</i></div></p>
  <p>Professor Wu assigned us the task of creating a simple 3D mesh with Blender to upload onto New Art City, a website that allows people to host their own virtual art gallery. The class would get their own little 3D world to host their objects on.</p>
  <p>This was a low-stakes project, considering that some students had no previous experience with 3D modeling. I'm lucky enough that I already had some previous experience with 3D modeling using Autodesk Maya during high school and community college, so my main goal was to adjust to the different UI shortcuts of Blender to complete the same methods I had learned prior.</p>

<p>This was my first time jumping back into 3D modeling after some time away from it, so I tried to focus on modeling something relatively simple. So, I modeled a rather simple, low-poly cactus. Its simple form allowed me to exercise and become comfortable with two important facets of 3D modeling that I'd use extensively later on: loop-cuts and extruding faces.</p>
